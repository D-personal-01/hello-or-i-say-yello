PROJECT TITLE
Randomized HELLO Text Generator Using Python

SHORT DESCRIPTION
This project is a Python program that generates a large number of unique visual variations of the word “HELLO” by randomly substituting each character with predefined alternative symbols. The program demonstrates randomness, set-based uniqueness enforcement, and character mapping, producing exactly 1000 distinct variations in a controlled manner.

FILES INCLUDED

hello.pyt
(Contains the Python source code responsible for generating and printing unique randomized variations of the word “HELLO”.)

README.txt
(Documentation explaining the project structure, execution steps, and learning objectives.)

HOW TO RUN

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Download or clone the project files to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

Run the program using the command:
python random_hello_generator.py

The program will automatically generate and display 1000 unique variations of the word “HELLO” along with the total count.

REQUIREMENTS

Python 3.x

Standard Python library (random module)

No external dependencies required

PURPOSE

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

Use of dictionaries for character mapping

Random selection using Python’s random module

Ensuring uniqueness using sets

String manipulation and iteration

Controlled generation of large unique outputs

This project serves as a practical exercise in randomness, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.
